    "\n",
    "The Data Access Framework allows developers to retrieve different types of data without having dependencies on those types of data. It provides a single, unified data type that can be customized by individual implementing plug-ins to provide full functionality pertinent to each data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing a New Factory\n",
    "\n",
    "Factories will most often be written in a dataplugin, but should always be written in a\n",
    "common plug-in. This will allow for clean dependencies from both CAVE and\n",
    "EDEX.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new plug-in’s data access class must implement IDataFactory. For ease of use,\n",
    "abstract classes have been created to combine similar methods. Data factories do not\n",
    "have to implement both types of data (grid and geometry). They can if they choose,\n",
    "but if they choose not to, they should do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    throw new UnsupportedOutputTypeException(request.getDatatype(), \"grid\");\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets the code know that grid type is not supported for this data factory.\n",
    "Depending on where the data is coming from, helpers have been written to make\n",
    "writing a new data type factory easier. For example, PluginDataObjects can use\n",
    "AbstractDataPluginFactory as a start and not have to create everything from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data type is allowed to implement retrieval in any manner that is felt necessary.\n",
    "The power of the framework means that the code retrieving data does not have to\n",
    "know anything of the underlying retrieval methods, only that it is getting data in \n",
    "a certain manner. To see some examples of ways to retrieve data, reference \n",
    "**SatelliteGridFactory** and **RadarGridFactory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods required for implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**public DataTime[] getAvailableTimes(IDataRequest request)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method returns an array of DataTime objects corresponding to what times are available for the data being retrieved, based on the parameters and identifiers being passed in.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**public DataTime[] getAvailableTimes(IDataRequest request, BinOffset binOffset)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method returns available times as above, only with a bin offset applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Both of the preceding methods can throw TimeAgnosticDataException exceptions if times do not apply to the data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**public IGridData[] getGridData(IDataRequest request, DataTime...times)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method returns IGridData objects (an array) based on the request and times to request for. There can be multiple times or a single time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**public IGridData[] getGridData(IDataRequest request, TimeRange range)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar to the preceding method, this returns IGridData objects based on a range of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**public IGeometryData[] getGeometryData(IDataRequest request, DataTime times)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method returns IGeometryData objects based on a request and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**public IGeometryData[] getGeometryData(IDataRequest request, TimeRange range)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Like the preceding method, this method returns IGeometryData objects based on a range of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**public String[] getAvailableLocationNames(IDataRequest request)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method returns location names that match the request. If this does not apply to the data type, an IncompatibleRequestException should be thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Registering the Factory with the Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The following needs to be added in a spring file in the plug-in that contains the\n",
    "new factory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <bean id=\"radarGridFactory\"\n",
    "        class=\"com.raytheon.uf.common.dataplugin.radar.dataaccess.RadarGridFactory\" /> \n",
    "    <bean factory-bean=\"dataAccessRegistry\" factorymethod=\"register\">\n",
    "        <constructor-arg value=\"radar\"/>\n",
    "        <constructor-arg ref=\"radarGridFactory\"/>\n",
    "    </bean>\n",
    "    \n",
    "This takes the RadarGridFactory and registers it with the registry and allows it to\n",
    "be used any time the code makes a request for the data type “radar.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieving Data Using the Factory \n",
    "\n",
    "For ease of use and more diverse use, there are multiple interfaces into the Data\n",
    "Access Layer. Currently, there is a Python implementation and a Java\n",
    "implementation, which have very similar method calls and work in a similar\n",
    "manner. Plug-ins that want to use the data access framework to retrieve data\n",
    "should include **com.raytheon.uf.common.dataaccess** as a Required Bundle in\n",
    "their MANIFEST.MF.\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve data using the Python interface :\n",

    "## Design/Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Access Framework is designed to provide a consistent interface for requesting and using geospatial data within CAVE or EDEX. Examples of geospatial data are grids, satellite, radar, metars, maps, river gage heights, FFMP basin data, airmets, etc. To allow for convenient use of geospatial data, the framework will support two types of requests: grids and geometries (points, polygons, etc). The framework will also hide implementation details of specific data types from users, making it easier to use data without worrying about how the data objects are structured or retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "A suggested mapping of some current data types to one of the two supported data requests is listed below. This list is not definitive and can be expanded. If a developer can dream up an interpretation of the data in the other supported request type, that support can be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grids\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grib\n",
    "* Satellite\n",
    "* Radar\n",
    "* GFE\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometries\n",
    "\n",
    "* Map (states, counties, zones, etc)\n",
    "* Hydro DB (IHFS)\n",
    "* Obs (metar)\n",
    "* FFMP\n",
    "* Hazard\n",
    "* Warning\n",
    "* CCFP\n",
    "* Airmet\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework is designed around the concept of each data type plugin contributing the necessary code for the framework to support its data. For example, the satellite plugin provides a factory class for interacting with the framework and registers itself as being compatible with the Data Access Framework. This concept is similar to how EDEX in AWIPS II expects a plugin developer to provide a decoder class and record class and register them, but then automatically manages the rest of the ingest process including routing, storing, and alerting on new data. This style of plugin architecture effectively enables the framework to expand its capabilities to more data types without having to alter the framework code itself. This will enable software developers to incrementally add support for more data types as time allows, and allow the framework to expand to new data types as they become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Access Framework will not break any existing functionality or APIs, and there are no plans to retrofit existing cosde to use the new API at this time. Ideally code will be retrofitted in the future to improve ease of maintainability. The plugin pecific code that hooks into the framework will make use of existing APIs such as **IDataStore** and **IServerRequest** to complete the requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Access Framework can be understood as three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How users of the framework retrieve and use the data\n",
    "* How plugin developers contribute support for new data types\n",
    "* How the framework works when it receives a request\n",
    "\n",
    "## How users of the framework retrieve and use the data\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user of the framework wishes to request data, they must instantiate a request object and set some of the values on that request. Two request interfaces will be supported, for detailed methods see section \"Detailed Code\" below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IDataRequest**\n",
    "\n",
    "**IGridRequest** extends **IDataRequest**\n",
    "\n",
    "**IGeometryRequest** extends **IDataRequest**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the request interfaces, default implementations of **DefaultGridRequest** and **DefaultGeometryRequest** will be provided to handle most cases. However, the use of interfaces allows for custom special cases in the future. If necessary, the developer of a plugin can write their own custom request implementation to handle a special case.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the request object has been prepared, the user will pass it to the Data Access Layer to receive a data object in return. See the \"Detailed Code\" section below for detailed methods of the Data Access Layer. The Data Access Layer will return one of two data interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IData**\n",
    "\n",
    "**IGridData** extends **IData**\n",
    "\n",
    "**IGeometryData** extends **IData**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data interfaces, the use of interfaces effectively hides the implementation details of specific data types from the user of the framework. For example, the user receives an **IGridData** and knows the data time, grid geometry, parameter, and level, but does not know that the data is actually a **GFEGridData** vs **D2DGridData** vs **SatelliteGridData**. This enables users of the framework to write generic code that can support multiple data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "For python users of the framework, the interfaces will be very similar with a few key distinctions. Geometries will be represented by python geometries from the open source Shapely project. For grids, the python **IGridData** will have a method for requesting the raw data as a numpy array, and the Data Access Layer will have methods for requesting the latitude coordinates and the longitude coordinates of grids as numpy arrays. The python requests and data objects will be pure python and not JEP PyJObjects that wrap Java objects. A future goal of the Data Access Framework is to provide support to python local apps and therefore enable requests of data outside of CAVE and EDEX to go through the same familiar interfaces. This goal is out of scope for this project but by making the request and returned data objects pure python it will not be a huge undertaking to add this support in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How plugin developers contribute support for new datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "When a developer wishes to add support for another data type to the framework, they must implement one or both of the factory interfaces within a common plugin. Two factory interfaces will be supported, for detailed methods see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IDataFactory**\n",
    "\n",
    "**IGridFactory** extends **IDataFactory**\n",
    "\n",
    "**IGeometryFactory** extends **IDataFactory**\n",
    "\n",
    "For some data types, it may be desired to add support for both types of requests. For example, the developer of grid data may want to provide support for both grid requests and geometry requests. In this case the developer would write two separate classes where one implements **IGridFactory** and the other implements **IGeometryFactory**. Furthermore, factories could be stacked on top of one another by having factory implementations call into the Data Access Layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a custom factory keyed to \"derived\" could be written for derived parameters, and the implementation of that factory may then call into the Data Access Layer to retrieve “grid” data. In this example the raw data would be retrieved through the **GridDataFactory** while the derived factory then applies the calculations before returning the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementations do not need to support all methods on the interfaces or all values on the request objects. For example, a developer writing the **MapGeometryFactory** does not need to support **getAvailableTimes()** because map data such as US counties is time agnostic. In this case the method should throw **UnsupportedOperationException** and the javadoc will indicate this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example would be the developer writing **ObsGeometryFactory** can ignore the Level field of the **IDataRequest** as there are not different levels of metar data, it is all at the surface. It is up to the factory writer to determine which methods and fields to support and which to ignore, but the factory writer should always code the factory with the user requesting data in mind. If a user of the framework could reasonably expect certain behavior from the framework based on the request, the factory writer should implement support for that behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract factories will be provided and can be extended to reduce the amount of code a factory developer has to write to complete some common actions that will be used by multiple factories. The factory should be capable of working within either CAVE or EDEX, therefore all of its server specific actions (e.g. database queries) should go through the Request/Handler API by using **IServerRequests**. CAVE can then send the **IServerRequests** to EDEX with **ThriftClient** while EDEX can use the **ServerRequestRouter** to process the **IServerRequests**, making the code compatible regardless of which JVM it is running inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the factory code is written, it must be registered with the framework as an available factory. This will be done through spring xml in a common plugin, with the xml file inside the res/spring folder of the plugin. Registering the factory will identify the datatype name that must match what users would use as the datatype on the **IDataRequest**, e.g. the word \"satellite\". Registering the factory also indicates to the framework what request types are supported, i.e. grid vs geometry or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the spring xml for a satellite factory is provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <bean id=\"satelliteFactory\" \n",
    "      class=\"com.raytheon.uf.common.dataplugin.satellite.SatelliteFactory\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "    <bean id=\"satelliteFactoryRegistered\" factory-bean=\"dataFactoryRegistry\" factory-method=\"register\">\n",
    "        <constructor-arg value=\"satellite\" />\n",
    "        <constructor-arg value=\"com.raytheon.uf.common.dataaccess.grid.IGridRequest\" />\n",
    "        <constructor-arg value=\"satelliteFactory\" />\n",
    "    </bean>\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the framework works when it receives a request\n",
    "\n",
    "**IDataRequest** requires a datatype to be set on every request. The framework will have a registry of existing factories for each data type (grid and geometry). When the Data Access Layer methods are called, it will first lookup in the registry for the factory that corresponds to the datatype on the **IDataRequest**. If no corresponding factory is found, it will throw an exception with a useful error message that indicates there is no current support for that datatype request. If a factory is found, it will delegate the processing of the request to the factory. The factory will receive the request and process it, returning the result back to the Data Access Layer which then returns it to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "By going through the Data Access Layer, the user is able to retrieve the data and use it without understanding which factory was used, how the factory retrieved the data, or what implementation of data was returned. This effectively frees the framework and users of the framework from any dependencies on any particular data types. Since these dependencies are avoided, the specific **IDataFactory** and **IData** implementations can be altered in the future if necessary and the code making use of the framework will not need to be changed as long as the interfaces continue to be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the Data Access Framework is a service that provides data in a consistent way, with the service capabilities being expanded by plugin developers who write support for more data types. Note that the framework itself is useless without plugins contributing and registering **IDataFactories**. Once the framework is coded, developers will need to be tasked to add the factories necessary to support the needed data types.\n",
